## Gaps and Next Steps

### Critical Gaps:

1. **Authentication System**
   - JWT-based authentication needs to be implemented
   - User registration and login flows required

2. **Additional Notification Channels**
   - Pushbullet integration
   - Pushover integration
   - Web Push notifications

3. **Persistent Database**
   - Transition from in-memory storage to PostgreSQL
   - Implement proper data models and migrations

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - Secure API key storage
   - Data encryption for sensitive information

### Next Steps:

1. Implement authentication system with JWT
2. Add Pushbullet and Pushover integrations
3. Set up PostgreSQL database connection
4. Enhance security for API keys and user data
5. Build plugin architecture for notification channels
6. Implement test notifications for all channels

## Conclusion

The application has a solid foundation with most core features implemented. The dashboard, subscription management, and basic notifications are functional. The next phase of development should focus on authentication, additional notification channels, and database persistence to fully meet the PRD requirements.
